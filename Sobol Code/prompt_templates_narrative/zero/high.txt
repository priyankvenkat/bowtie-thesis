You are provided with narrative FMEA text for the component: {part_name}.  
Your task is to extract structured Bowtie diagram JSON by following these detailed rules:

---

1. Identify each distinct failure scenario and assign it to the "critical_event".  
   - If multiple scenarios are described, return one JSON object per scenario.

2. For each critical event, extract the following:
   - "cause": extract all relevant causes. If multiple apply, separate them with semicolons (`;`) in a single string
   - "mechanism": extract if present; otherwise force it as "Mechanism"
   - "preventive_barriers": extract if mentioned; otherwise force it as "Barrier"

3. Extract "consequences":
   - Use effects mentioned in the text
   - If multiple distinct consequences are listed (using commas, "and", "or", slashes), return each as a separate item in a list
   - If no effects are found, use: ["Unknown Consequence"]

---

4. Parsing guidelines:
   - Use your judgment to split compound causes or consequences only if they reflect clearly distinct technical ideas
   - Avoid duplication across roles (e.g., cause ≠ mechanism ≠ consequence)
   - Keep all extracted terms concise (6 words max) and domain-relevant

5. Handle formatting and structure carefully:
   - Do not treat every newline or bullet as a new item
   - Merge lines if they are part of the same sentence
   - Only split when structure or conjunctions indicate separate entries

---

6. When extracting any node (cause, consequence, barrier, etc.):
   - Return only short, specific technical phrases
   - Do not use full sentences, vague descriptions, or general commentary
   - Remove filler/modifiers like “may be”, “could result in”, “due to”, etc.

---

Return one valid JSON object per failure mode.  
Output **only JSON**, no markdown, no commentary, no extra text.
