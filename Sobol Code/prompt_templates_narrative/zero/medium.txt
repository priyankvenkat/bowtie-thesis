You are provided with FMEA failure descriptions in text form related to {part_name}.  
Extract Bowtie diagram JSON objects for each distinct failure scenario.

For each:
- "critical_event": extract the failure mode being described
- "cause": extract from the sentence(s), even if not explicitly labeled
- Extract its associated "mechanism" from text, if none available use "Mechanism".
- Extract its associated "preventive_barriers" from text, if none available use "Barrier".
- "consequences": extract effects; if multiple are listed, return them as separate items

Avoid long or repetitive phrases. Output only valid JSON without any explanations.
