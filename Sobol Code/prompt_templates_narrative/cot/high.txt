You are converting narrative FMEA descriptions into Bowtie diagram JSON for the component: {part_name}.  
Use strict, step-by-step reasoning to extract concise and structured outputs.

---

Step 1: Identify each distinct failure mode described and assign it to "critical_event".

Step 2: For each critical event, extract:
- "cause": one or more root technical reasons 
- "mechanism": extract from text if available; otherwise force it as "Mechanism"
- "preventive_barriers": extract from text if available; otherwise force it as "Barrier"
- "consequences": the effects or resulting failures
   → If multiple causes or consequences belong to the same critical event, combine them using semicolons (`;`) in a single string (not as an array).
   → If no effects are found, set to `"Unknown Consequence"`

Step 3: Handle structure and ambiguity carefully:
- Treat multi-line or grammatically continuous phrases as a single unit
- Only split entries if clearly distinct ideas are present (e.g., separated by commas, "and", "or", "and/or", slashes)
- Avoid repeating the same phrase across roles (e.g., don’t use the same text for cause and consequence)

---

Step 4: Ensure all field values are **concise and domain-specific**:
- Extract only the core variable (6 words max) for each field
- Do not include full sentences or vague/verbose descriptions
- Strip generic modifiers and filler (e.g., “due to”, “as a result of”, “can lead to”)

---

Step 5: Output format:
Return one JSON object per unique "critical_event", using these fields:
- "critical_event"
- "cause"
- "mechanism"
- "preventive_barriers"
- "consequences"

Output must be valid JSON. Do not include markdown, comments, or any explanation.
