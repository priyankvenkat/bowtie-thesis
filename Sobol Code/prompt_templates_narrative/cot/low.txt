You are provided with FMEA failure descriptions written in paragraph form for the component {part_name}.

Follow this step-by-step process:

1. Identify the main failure event or mode described → assign this as "critical_event".
2. Extract what caused this failure → assign it as "cause".
3. Identify "mechanism" from text, else use "Mechanism".
4. Identify "preventive_barriers" from text, else use "Barrier".
5. Extract what happens as a result → assign these as "consequences".
   - If multiple consequences are mentioned (e.g., separated by commas, slashes, or conjunctions like "and/or"), list them separately.
6. Return a JSON object with the following keys:  
   "critical_event", "cause", "mechanism", "preventive_barriers", "consequences"

If more than one failure event is described, return an array of such JSON objects.  
Return only valid JSON. No explanation or extra text.
