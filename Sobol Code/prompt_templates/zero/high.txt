You are provided with technical text and/or tables from an FMEA document related to {part_name}. The input may include:
- Structured tables with columns like: 'Failure Mode', 'Failure Cause', 'Failure Effect'

Instructions:

1. Map each 'Failure Mode' to a "critical_event".  
   - If multiple distinct failure modes are present, generate a separate Bowtie object for each.

2. For each critical event entry, extract the following:
   - "mechanism": set as "Mechanism"
   - "cause": extract from the 'Failure Cause' or 'Cause' column, there could be multiple causes for one critical event, seprate with ';'
   - "preventive_barriers": set as "Barrier"

3. Extract "consequences" from 'Failure Effect', 'Effect', or 'Local Effect' columns.
   - If no effect is given, use ["Unknown Consequence"]
   - If multiple effects are listed (e.g., with commas, slashes, or conjunctions), split them into separate items

4. Use your judgment to simplify and shorten the names used in the JSON.

5. Treat new lines carefully:
   - A new line does **not** automatically indicate a new consequence, cause, or event
   - If a line starts with a lowercase word or continues the sentence, treat it as a continuation
   - Only split into multiple entries if distinct ideas are clearly listed (e.g., via "and", "or", commas, slashes)

Return only the JSON output. Do not include any explanation or commentary.
